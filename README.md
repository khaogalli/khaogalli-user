## Getting Started

To get started with the development environment:

1. **Install Expo CLI**:  
   Make sure you have the Expo CLI installed. You can install it globally using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install -g expo-cli
   ```

2. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-folder>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the App**:
   Use the Expo CLI to start the project. This will open the Expo Developer Tools in your browser.

   ```bash
   expo start
   ```

   You can then use the Expo Go app on your mobile device to view your project or use an emulator.

## Available Scripts

- `expo start`: Starts the Expo development server.
- `expo build`: Builds the project for deployment.
